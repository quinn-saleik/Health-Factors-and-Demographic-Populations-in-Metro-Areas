# Health-Factors-in-Metro-Areas
This exploratory study utilizes Big Cities Health Coalition data from top metro areas in the U.S. to dive into complex relations between racial demographics and categorical, sub-categorical, and specific health risks. Through a process of data cleaning, database combination, hypothesis testing, multiple regression modeling, and interactive visual representations, this study explores various trends, disparities, and projections to analyze the significance of population health risks.
 
Further, the study’s analysis incorporates population-specific segregation indices provided in the dataset to determine segregation measures’ correlation with categories and subcategories of health risks. By visualizing and statistically interpreting these results, one derives timely implications surrounding societal and environmental health risks in contemporary urban settings.
